<!-- I decided to take a second to pause from working on this portfolio and look more deeply into wireframing. I noticed that I've been basically freestyling my web pages and I find myself constantly writing and rewriting code with no clear end in sight. Luckily a fellow coder at my city's FCC meetup reminded me of the benefits of wireframing and why I should start adding it to my workflow as soon as possible. Once I read up on it, I'll come back to implement what I've learned so far. -->
